<h1 class="text-center text-3xl text-purple-500">About Me</h1>
<p>
	I was born in 1991 in the little known island nation of Vanuatu where my dad was doing some
	contracting work at the time. I moved to New Zealand in 1993 where I lived first in Hawkes Bay and
	later in Stokes Valley, not far from Wellington. I moved to the UK in July 2005 where over the
	last 20 years I have lived in Bromborough, Lancaster, Chester, and Wrexham.
