	This page gives some information about me personally but with a focus on stuff related to
	technology and development.
</p>
<p>
	I was born in 1991 on the little known island nation of <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a
	> where my dad was doing some contracting work at the time. I moved to New Zealand in 1993 where I
	lived first in Hawkes Bay and later in Stokes Valley, not far from Wellington. I moved to the UK in
	July 2005 where over the last 20 years I have lived in Bromborough, Lancaster, Chester, and Wrexham.

	I've been around computers since I was young, initially mainly using them to play games. But as I
	grew up, so did the internet, and I started experimenting with building sites in HTML and adding
	interactivity with JavaScript. These websites initially weren't deployed anywhere and were written
	locally using Windows Notepad. Although this was a good learning experience, something was missing
	and I wondered how the websites I used on a daily basis provided the features that they did. This
	is when I discovered the server side, PHP and began using the humble <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP stack</a
	> which came to dominate the internet for years to come.
</p>
<p>
	Although PHP has been much derided over the years (for some good reasons) it was a very powerful
	and accessible stack which gave me exposure to lots of fundamental programming concepts and being
	able to make changes and see them instantly reflected was a very powerful learning tool. I mostly
	used PHP for little projects related to things that interested me personally, or for family and
	friends.
</p>
<p>
	Although I have always been interested in computers, for my formal education I did something
	completely unrelated, studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Lancaster University from
	2009-2012. I had a great time at Lancaster, gaining a lot of life experience and making some
	lifelong friends but won't dwell on it too much as I didn't do too much computer related other
	than building a website for a University newspaper and playing a lot of Age of Empires 3.
</p>
<p>
	I started my professional IT career in 2014 at a consultancy called FDM which provided contractors
	to various blue chip companies, mostly in Financial Services. I was placed at Barclays where I
	initially worked as a manual tester. In 2017, I transitioned from a contractor to permanent staff
	with Barclays and a couple of years later I moved from testing into Solution Architecture where I
	have worked ever since.
